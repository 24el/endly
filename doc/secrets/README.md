# Secrets / Credentials
     
    
Endly on its core uses SSH or other system/cloud service requiring credentials. 
To run system workflow the credentials file/s need to be supplied as various request field.


Endly uses  [Credentail Config](https://github.com/viant/toolbox/blob/master/cred/config.go) 
  * it can store user and blowfish encrypted password generated by "endly -c option".
    * it can store google cloud compatible secret.json fields
  * it can store AWS cloud compatible fields.
  * $HOME/.secret/ directory is used to store endly credentials


Endly service was design in a way to  hide user secrets, for example, whether sudo access is needed,
endly will output **sudo** in the execution event log and screen rather actual password.
     

To generate credentials file to enable endly exec service to run on localhost:

Provide a username and password to login to your box.

```text
mkdir $HOME/.secret
ssh-keygen -b 1024 -t rsa -f id_rsa -P "" -f $HOME/.secret/id_rsa
touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
cat $HOME/.secret/id_rsa.pub >>  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys 
chmod u+w authorized_keys

endly -c=localhost -k=~/.secret/id_rsa.pub
```


Verify that secret file were created
```text
cat ~/.secret/localhost.json
```     
Now you can use ${env.HOME}./secret/localhost.json as you localhost credentials.
